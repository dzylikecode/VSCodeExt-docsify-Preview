[docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) is a magical documentation site generator. What the plugin does is to help you see the preview of your markdown file when writing it so that you can get a better feedback. What you see is what you get.

## Known Issues

The scroll will be put at the wrong position when openning the `docsify Preivew` the first time. So you must scroll the markdown slightly to make the scroll at the right position. Hope this issue will be fixed in the future, and you are tolerant to this issue.
